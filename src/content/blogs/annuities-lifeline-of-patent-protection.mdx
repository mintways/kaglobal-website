  {/* Intro */}
  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
    In the world of intellectual property, securing a patent is only the beginning. To maintain exclusive rights
    over your invention, patent annuity payments—also known as renewal fees—play a pivotal role.
  </p>

  {/* What Are Patent Annuities */}

      What Are Patent Annuities?
    </h2>
    <p className="mt-3">
      Patent annuities are recurring fees paid to patent offices to keep a granted patent in force. These payments
      typically begin in the third year after filing and continue annually for up to 20 years, depending on
      jurisdiction. Failure to pay annuities on time can result in patent lapse, leaving your invention vulnerable to
      public use without legal recourse.

    </h2>
    <ul className="mt-4 space-y-2 list-disc list-inside text-gray-700">
      <li><strong>Preserve market exclusivity:</strong> Timely payments keep your patent enforceable and your edge protected.</li>
      <li><strong>Optimize portfolio costs:</strong> Decide where to maintain vs. prune to focus on high-value assets.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid legal risks:</strong> Missing payments can cause irreversible loss of rights in strict jurisdictions.</li>

      Jurisdictional Nuances: India as a Case Study
    </h2>
    <p className="mt-3">
      In India, annuity payments begin from the <strong>third year</strong> after the <strong>patent filing date</strong>.
      Under <strong>Section 53</strong> and <strong>Rule 80</strong>:
    </p>
    <ul className="mt-4 space-y-2 list-disc list-inside text-gray-700">
      <li>The fee must be paid <strong>in advance before the expiration</strong> of the previous year.</li>
      <li><strong>No annuity is due during pendency</strong> of a patent application.</li>
      <li>A <strong>six-month grace period</strong> is available with surcharge for late payments.</li>
    </ul>
